// Automatic progression (issue #17).
//
// Everything here is a pure function of the workout history. Nothing writes back into a
// finished workout: the log is what happened, and the next prescription is *derived* from
// it every time it is needed. That means changing a policy — or fixing a mistyped set —
// immediately produces the right next target, with no stored counters to drift out of sync.
//
// It replaces a single hard-coded rule ("all reps done → add 2.5") with a small set of named
// policies. The rule that applies is always visible in the app, together with the reason it
// picked this weight, because a suggestion you can't audit is one you stop trusting.
//
// Reading a session honestly is the whole game:
//   · a set checked off with at least its target reps  → hit
//   · a set checked off with fewer reps                → miss (you logged what you got)
//   · a set never checked off                          → miss (it was not performed)
//   · fewer sets than prescribed                       → miss
// So a session that fell apart can never advance the load as though it had succeeded.
