# EP-11 — Capacitor Bluetooth LE and Wearable Support Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` (recommended for behavior, data, security and hardware work) or `superpowers:executing-plans` to implement each reviewed task. Use `superpowers:test-driven-development` for each behavior change. This document is an outline until its feature-specific design has been approved and exact source paths confirmed. Steps use `- [ ]` for progress tracking.

**Goal:** Connect selected verified BLE devices without duplicating existing health-store integrations.

**Architecture:** Add narrowly scoped behavior to the existing React/Zustand/Node/Capacitor system; each milestone can be tested and reviewed independently.

**Tech stack:** Existing React 19 / JavaScript / Vite / Node 22, repository-native unit and integration tests, optional explicitly named libraries.

**Spec:** `docs/product/PRODUCT_SPEC.md` and `docs/product/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`.

**Dependencies:** EP-01; 10 optional (numbers or notes as written).

## Global constraints

- Preserve baseline workouts, offline operation, current profile sync, auth and backups.
- New services and permissions default off. No production changes, merges or publication without separate approval.
- Check exact upstream licenses, service APIs and model terms at implementation time.
- Feature code must use test-first RED/GREEN/REFACTOR and a meaningful reviewer gate.

## Proposed file map

`frontend/src/lib/health-sync.js` (existing), `frontend/src/lib/ble/{permissions,devices,stream}.js` (proposed), Capacitor plugin config and integration screen.

> Proposed paths are not guaranteed to exist. Confirm actual code layout and integration seams before writing; document changes to the file map.

## Review focus

Unsupported manufacturer protocols, OS permission disparities, duplicate HR from Apple Health, background disconnect, timestamp drift and data retention.

## Cross-module interfaces

- **Inputs:** current authenticated profile and existing domain records; optional external data only through bounded validated adapters.
- **Outputs:** normalized and versioned records or read-only derived UI values, not hidden global side effects.
- **Failures:** explicit opt-out/unavailable/retry behavior; no negative impact on core workout logging.
- **Handoff:** versioned API/record contract and suite log linked in the PR, reviewed before dependent epic starts.

## Task checklist

### Task 1 — Select explicit hardware profiles

- [ ] **Inspect:** Document manufacturer/model, BLE service/characteristic UUIDs, sample units, platform permission contract and existing Health Connect/Apple Health overlap. Defer if no supported device.
- [ ] **RED:** Add a focused failing outcome test for the described user behavior or contract; capture the assertion and failure reason.
- [ ] **GREEN:** Implement the smallest feature to satisfy that test, with schema/permissions and UI as needed.
- [ ] **REFACTOR:** Remove unnecessary duplication and isolate responsibilities; rerun focused tests.
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Confirm the expected result below, relevant regression tests, and actual browser/device checks where applicable.
- [ ] **COMMIT/REVIEW:** Commit with a scoped message and request spec-compliance plus code-quality review before moving on.

**Expected outcome:** Approved device matrix and data-source preference rules.

### Task 2 — TDD packet parsing and source dedup

- [ ] **Inspect:** RED tests for malformed/unexpected packets, missing timestamp, sensor rollover, duplicate HR and unit conversion. Implement pure parser before plugin calls.
- [ ] **RED:** Add a focused failing outcome test for the described user behavior or contract; capture the assertion and failure reason.
- [ ] **GREEN:** Implement the smallest feature to satisfy that test, with schema/permissions and UI as needed.
- [ ] **REFACTOR:** Remove unnecessary duplication and isolate responsibilities; rerun focused tests.
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Confirm the expected result below, relevant regression tests, and actual browser/device checks where applicable.
- [ ] **COMMIT/REVIEW:** Commit with a scoped message and request spec-compliance plus code-quality review before moving on.

**Expected outcome:** Stable source IDs, timestamp handling and accurate normalized values.

### Task 3 — Implement opt-in connect/revoke UI

- [ ] **Inspect:** Integrate version-matched Capacitor BLE plugin with explicit permissions, pair/unpair, reconnect/backoff and stale-stream display. No unauthorized background tracking.
- [ ] **RED:** Add a focused failing outcome test for the described user behavior or contract; capture the assertion and failure reason.
- [ ] **GREEN:** Implement the smallest feature to satisfy that test, with schema/permissions and UI as needed.
- [ ] **REFACTOR:** Remove unnecessary duplication and isolate responsibilities; rerun focused tests.
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Confirm the expected result below, relevant regression tests, and actual browser/device checks where applicable.
- [ ] **COMMIT/REVIEW:** Commit with a scoped message and request spec-compliance plus code-quality review before moving on.

**Expected outcome:** On-device hardware test shows accurate connection state and stop behavior.

### Task 4 — Protect workout operation

- [ ] **Inspect:** Disable BLE and test baseline workout/session, timers, watch and phone health integrations.
- [ ] **RED:** Add a focused failing outcome test for the described user behavior or contract; capture the assertion and failure reason.
- [ ] **GREEN:** Implement the smallest feature to satisfy that test, with schema/permissions and UI as needed.
- [ ] **REFACTOR:** Remove unnecessary duplication and isolate responsibilities; rerun focused tests.
- [ ] **VERIFY:** Confirm the expected result below, relevant regression tests, and actual browser/device checks where applicable.
- [ ] **COMMIT/REVIEW:** Commit with a scoped message and request spec-compliance plus code-quality review before moving on.

**Expected outcome:** No impact when BLE unavailable, offline or module off.

## Verification and acceptance

**Minimum evidence:** Simulated BLE packet fixtures, physical device permission/reconnect, Android+iOS build, HR source dedup, no sensor fallback.

- [ ] Relevant pure unit tests, negative cases, integration/E2E checks and complete impacted regressions pass.
- [ ] All new routes are reflected in the OpenAPI spec; generated docs match.
- [ ] Accessibility, localization, reduced motion, performance and privacy impacts are reviewed.
- [ ] Feature is correctly disabled without breaking baseline app, and README/docs explain setup and rollback.
- [ ] Draft PR is linked to this plan; every claimed test has a specific run or artifact.
- [ ] No direct merge/deploy and no unrelated changes.

## Execution handoff

Before code: inspect latest repository baseline and confirm the feature design as a separate small spec. After implementation: report files, commits, RED/GREEN evidence, complete regression status, actual screenshots where relevant, licensing, blockers and next dependency. No feature is complete on a plan-only or UI-only basis.
