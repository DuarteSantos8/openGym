# Building the mobile app (iOS / Android)

openGym ships in two flavors from the same codebase:

| | **Self-hosted** (this repo's default) | **Mobile app** (`VITE_MOBILE=1`) |
|---|---|---|
| Runs | in any browser, against your own server | natively on iPhone / Android (Capacitor shell) |
| Accounts | passkey sign-in, one profile per person | none — the phone *is* the account |
| Data | synced to your server, readable on desktop | stays on the device (file in the app's private storage) |
| Reminders | Web Push from your server | native local notifications, no server involved |
| Exercise media | served by your server (`img/`, `gif/`) | loaded from the jsDelivr CDN |

The mobile flavor never talks to a backend: no sign-in screen, no sync, no telemetry.
State is mirrored from `localStorage` into `opengym-state.json` in the app's private data
directory on every change (iOS is allowed to evict WebView storage under pressure — the
file mirror is the durable copy and is restored on launch). Backups go out through the
OS share sheet instead of a browser download.

## Prerequisites

- Node 20+
- **Android:** Android Studio (bundles the SDK). Java 21 for Gradle.
- **iOS:** a Mac with Xcode 15+, plus CocoaPods (`brew install cocoapods`), and an
  Apple Developer account to run on a device / distribute.

## Build & run

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build:mobile        # VITE_MOBILE build + `cap sync` into android/ and ios/

npx cap open android        # opens Android Studio → run on emulator or device
npx cap open ios            # opens Xcode (Mac only) → set your signing team, then run
```

`npm run build:mobile` bakes the CDN media base into the bundle and copies the web build
into both native projects — re-run it after every web-code change before building natively.

> **Heads-up:** after `build:mobile`, `frontend/dist` contains the *mobile* bundle.
> Run a plain `npm run build` again before deploying `dist` to a server.

## App icons & splash screens

`frontend/resources/icon.svg` is the 1024×1024 source (the app's dumbbell glyph on the
app background). Generate all platform assets from it on a machine with the tooling:

```sh
cd frontend
npx @capacitor/assets generate --iconBackgroundColor '#0c0e12' --splashBackgroundColor '#0c0e12'
```

(If the generator won't take the SVG directly, export it to `resources/icon.png` at
1024×1024 first — any image tool can do it.)

## Store submission notes

- Bump `versionName`/`versionCode` in `android/app/build.gradle` and the version in Xcode
  per release; keep them in step with `frontend/package.json`.
- **License:** openGym is AGPL-3.0, which by itself sits badly with app-store terms of
  service. `NOTICE.md` therefore carries an app-store exception (an additional permission
  under AGPL §7) granted by the copyright holder.
- The app requests notification permission only when the workout-day reminder is switched
  on, and (on Android) declares `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` so the reminder fires to the minute
  where the user allows it.
